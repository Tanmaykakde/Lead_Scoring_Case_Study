<br>
<h2>Details about the case study: -</h2>
<ul>
  <li>This project is the case study on the problem faced by X Education company to convert their leads as their customer, which sells online courses to the   
      professionals.</li>
  <li>Their problem is that, only 30% of the leads are getting converted.
  <li>So, a solution is demanded to acquire a conversion rate of 80% of their leads to the customers.</li>
  <li>In this project we have tried to implement a model based on Logistic regression to achieve the above goal. </li>
</ul>
<br><br>
  <h2>For this project we have following documents to build and support our case study:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Lead Scoring Case Study Python Notebook.ipbny</li>
  <li>Lead Scoring Case Study PPT.pdf</li>
  <li>Lead Scoring Case Study Summary Report.pdf</li> 
  <li>Lead Scoring Subjective Questions and Answers.pdf</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
This project case study is useful for all such platforms which are dealing with lot of applicants on the platform but a much smaller customer conversion rate e.g. lets say people tend to try a free trial but wont go for the paid version. It is hard for the companies also to find potential customers.
<br>
<h2>Approach taken to find the solution is as follows:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Reading data dictionary</li>
  <li>Loading dataframe</li>
  <li>Treating null values or dropping them</li>
  <li>Performing EDA</li>
  <li>Finding best features by using RFE</li>
  <li>Building model using Logistic Regression</li>
  <li>Re-building after checking for multicollinearity</li> 
  <li>Deploying on test dataframe</li>
  <li>Evaluating model</li>
  <li>Drawing conclusions from results</li>
</ol>  
 <br><br>
<h2>This case study is built by a group of three students of a masterâ€™s program .</h2>
